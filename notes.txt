Leaf parallelization, i.e. parallel execution of many playouts from one leaf of the game tree.
Root parallelization, i.e. building independent game trees in parallel and making the move basing on the root-level branches of all these trees.
Tree parallelization, i.e. parallel building of the same game tree, protecting data from simultaneous writes either with one, global mutex, with more mutexes, or with non-blocking synchronization.
